# Weather-Monitoring-System
Weather monitoring plays an important role in human life, so the collection of information about the temporal dynamics of weather changes is very important. The Weather Monitoring System is an advanced solution for monitoring the weather conditions at a particular place and make the information visible anywhere in the world. The technology behind this system is Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting the things to the internet. IoT systems allow users to achieve deeper automation, analysis, and integration within a system. They improve the reach of these areas and their accuracy. IoT utilizes existing and emerging technology for sensing and networking.
The Weather Monitoring System deals with monitoring the weather conditions like temperature and humidity with sensors. Using Raspberry Pi is the best way to get started on working with the IoT (Internet of Things) and to build your knowledge to expand it to other applications. The raspberry Pi is interfaced with a temperature sensor and Humidity sensor and reads data from it through its GPIO pins. After this, the data is relayed to a web server and subsequently pushed to your Android device. The process of sending data to the Database is repeated after constant time intervals. This provides better understanding on weather changes reported.
